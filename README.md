# kickstart
  next.js + semantic-ui-react + solidity
  client side: metamask
  before start server, install metamask first, as client interface
1. in the root folder, type : npm install --save to install all the dependency need.
2. in the root folder, type : npm run dev to run the server. type localhost:3000 to show the main page.
3. this project is on rinkeby test network right now, so it won't spend actual bitcoin.
